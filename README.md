## Cplusplus.com
CplusPlus.com is a React-based web application designed to provide resources for C++ programming language learners. The project includes several key features:

1. **Home Page**: Features a sidebar navigation, featured content slider, and latest forum activity.
2. **Reference Section**: Offers comprehensive documentation on C++ libraries including C Library, Containers, Input/Output streams, Multi-threading, and other miscellaneous headers.
3. **Articles Page**: Displays categorized articles with pagination, filtering options, and a responsive design for mobile users.
4. **Tutorials**: Educational content for learning C++ from basics to advanced topics.
5. **Forum**: Community interaction space for discussions about C++ programming.



The application uses modern React features including hooks (useState, useEffect), React Router for navigation, and Framer Motion for animations.
The project follows a component-based architecture with separate CSS files for styling each component.

## Project Structure
- `/src`
  - `/assets` - Contains images and other static files
  - `/components` - React components (Home, Reference, ArticlesList, etc.)
  - `/DataInfo` - JavaScript files containing application data (referenceData, containerData, etc.)
  - Standard React files (App.jsx, index.css, etc.)
